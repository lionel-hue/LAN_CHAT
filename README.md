A user establishes a server connection and waits... meanwhile the other user also establishes the client connection and connects to the server and the offline communication begins ! 

- `Downlaod zip` and browse through the source code  to inspect and probably tweak the software
  
- `Use your C compiler to compiler ` to  compile the project. If you have your C compilert installed, then run the '_LAN_CHAT_GCC.bat' cmd exectuable to compile the project. It will be finally available newly compiled in the parent directory.
  
- Or if you simply want to use the software directly `navigate through the 'lanCHAT'` folder and run APPLICATION.exe 

## NOTE ‚ùó
- Windows 10 or higher with 64bit/32bit architecture required.
- Possibility to change the theme of the application to prefered style.
